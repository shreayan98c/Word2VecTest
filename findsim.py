# Logging is in general a good practice to check the behavior of your code
# while it's running. Compared to calling `print`, it provides two benefits.
# - It prints to standard error (stderr), not standard output (stdout) by
#   default. This means it won't interfere with the real output of your
#   program. 
# - You can configure how much logging information is provided, by
#   controlling the logging 'level'. You have a few options, like
#   'debug', 'info', 'warning', and 'error'. By setting a global flag,
#   you can ensure that the information you want - and only that info -
#   is printed. As an example:
#        >>> try:
#        ...     rare_word = "prestidigitation"
#        ...     vocab.get_counts(rare_word)
#        ... except KeyError:
#        ...     log.error(f"Word that broke the program: {rare_word}")
#        ...     log.error(f"Current contents of vocab: {vocab.data}")
#        ...     raise  # Crash the program; can't recover.
#        >>> log.info(f"Size of vocabulary is {len(vocab)}")
#        >>> if len(vocab) == 0:
#        ...     log.warning(f"Empty vocab. This may cause problems.")
#        >>> log.debug(f"The values are {vocab}")
#   If we set the log level to be 'INFO', only the log.info, log.warning,
#   and log.error statements will be printed. You can calibrate exactly how 
#   much info you need, and when. None of these pollute stdout with things 
#   that aren't the real 'output' of your program.
#
# In `parse_args`, we provided two command line options to control the logging level.
# The default level is 'INFO'. You can lower it to 'DEBUG' if you pass '--verbose'
# and you can raise it to 'WARNING' if you pass '--quiet'.
